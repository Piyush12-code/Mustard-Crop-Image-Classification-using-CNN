This project focuses on classifying mustard crop images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a large-scale dataset of 400,000+ images and achieves an accuracy of approximately 90%.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how deep learning techniques can be applied to agricultural image analysis, supporting smarter crop monitoring and decision-making.
